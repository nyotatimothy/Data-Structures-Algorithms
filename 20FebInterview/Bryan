# Technical Excellence: Coding + Collaboration

## Focus Areas
- Technical Skills: Coding / Pseudo code interview focus on algorithms and Data Structures
- **Behavioral Competency: Collaboration, working with others, unblock and team player**

## Interview Questions and Responses

### Cross-functional Team Collaboration
**Q: Describe a time when you worked on a challenging cross-functional team that produced an exceptional deliverable.**

During the Secure Future Initiative project, I worked with the MISE team, data scientists, and IT operations to flag non-compliant dSTS applications. This cross-functional effort required aligning different expertise and perspectives. By facilitating regular meetings and open communication, we successfully delivered a robust solution that enhanced compliance monitoring.

### Building New Relationships
**Q: Tell me about a time when you developed a relationship with another area of the company that had no previous history of collaboration.**

Initially, our team had limited interaction with the MISE team. I took the initiative to reach out and establish a collaborative relationship by offering assistance with their PowerBi versioning and regression testing. This proactive approach led to our involvement in the Secure Future Initiative, fostering a strong partnership that benefited both teams.

### External Team Problem Resolution
**Q: Describe how you have collaborated with others outside of your immediate team to resolve a critical issue.**

When faced with the IDX deployment cadence challenge, I collaborated with the Azure DevOps team to implement a flexible deployment strategy. This involved coordinating with their engineers to integrate our CI/CD pipelines, which significantly reduced deployment times and ensured timely updates for the MISE team.

### Conflict Resolution
**Q: Tell me about a time when you experienced conflict with a team member.**

During the project, there was a disagreement with a team member over the data model's complexity. I addressed this by organizing a workshop where we could discuss our perspectives and align on a simplified yet effective model. This approach resolved the conflict and strengthened our working relationship.

### Virtual Team Collaboration
**Q: Describe your most recent experience working with a virtual team. What were the challenges you faced and how did you work through them?**

The project involved virtual collaboration with team members across different time zones. The main challenge was coordinating meetings and ensuring everyone was on the same page. I implemented asynchronous communication tools and scheduled regular updates to keep the team aligned, which improved our efficiency and cohesion.

### Learning from Unsuccessful Collaboration
**Q: Tell me about a time when your attempt to collaborate across teams was unsuccessful.**

In a previous project, I attempted to collaborate with a team that was resistant to change. Despite my efforts to demonstrate the benefits, the collaboration didn't materialize. Reflecting on this, I realized the importance of understanding team dynamics and building trust before proposing changes.

## Probing Questions and Responses

### Initial Involvement
**Q: How did you first get involved?**

I got involved when the MISE team reached out through a Microsoft vchannel, following my assistance with a colleague's PowerBi work. This initial interaction opened the door for further collaboration.

### Project Outcome
**Q: What was the outcome?**

The outcome was a successful implementation of a system that effectively flagged non-compliant applications, improving compliance monitoring and data integrity.

### Obstacle Management
**Q: Did you run into any obstacles? Pick one and tell me how you addressed it.**

One obstacle was the IDX deployment cadence. I addressed it by proposing and implementing a flexible deployment strategy, which involved collaborating with the Azure DevOps team to streamline our CI/CD processes.

### Retrospective
**Q: Looking back at this situation, what was the key to success? What would you do differently?**

The key to success was proactive communication and building strong relationships across teams. In hindsight, I would have initiated the flexible deployment strategy earlier to avoid initial delays.

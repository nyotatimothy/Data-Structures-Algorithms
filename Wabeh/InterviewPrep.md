## Elevator pitch
Hi, I'm Timothy! I'm a software engineer with over 10 years of experience at companies like Microsoft and IBM, specializing in building secure, scalable systems. My unique background spans both tech and fintech - I've built financial systems at Umati Capital and hold both a CPA and MBA, giving me deep insight into how technology can revolutionize finance.

What drives me is creating impactful solutions that expand financial access, especially in emerging markets like Kenya. I thrive on complex challenges, whether it's designing authentication systems or real-time platforms that can scale to serve millions of users.


## Key Questions
"Given your focus on credit scoring and risk assessment for BNPL, how do you handle the unique challenges of assessing creditworthiness in markets with limited formal credit history data?"

"What's your approach to building resilient systems that can handle the high-stakes nature of real-time financial decisions? How do you balance speed with accuracy and risk management?"

"Could you tell me about your data infrastructure and how you're leveraging machine learning for credit decisioning? What kinds of data sources and models have proven most effective?"

## "Tell me about your experience with building scalable backend services, particularly focusing on Python and AWS."
Answer:
"You know, at Microsoft, I've been working on some really interesting authentication systems that handle millions of users every day. One of the coolest projects I worked on was the passwordless sign-in feature. We used Python with FastAPI, and I got to play around with a lot of AWS services. We set up Lambda functions for the heavy lifting, DynamoDB for managing user sessions, and CloudWatch to keep an eye on everything. The best part was seeing how the system automatically scaled up when we had traffic spikes. It's actually quite similar to what you're building at Wabeh with your credit scoring system."
## "How have you handled security and compliance in financial systems?"
Answer:
"Oh, this is something I'm really passionate about! At Umati Capital, I worked on their invoice discounting system, which was handling some pretty sensitive financial data. We had to be super careful with security. I remember spending a lot of time setting up proper authentication and making sure all the data was encrypted. We also had to keep detailed logs of every transaction - you know how it is with financial systems, you need to be able to track everything. It was challenging but really rewarding to build something that people could trust with their financial data."
## "Describe your experience with DevOps and CI/CD pipelines."
Answer:
"At Microsoft, we've got this really smooth deployment process that I helped set up. It's pretty cool - when we push code, it automatically runs through all our tests, builds the containers, and deploys to different environments. We're using GitHub Actions and AWS CodePipeline, and I've been working a lot with Terraform to manage our infrastructure. It's like having a well-oiled machine - you push your code, and everything else just happens automatically. It's saved us so much time and reduced a lot of the deployment headaches we used to have."
## "How do you approach testing and quality assurance?"
Answer:
"I'm a big believer in testing early and often. At Microsoft, we've got this multi-layered approach that's worked really well for us. We start with unit tests, then integration tests, and we also do performance testing to make sure everything runs smoothly under load. One thing I'm particularly proud of is our automated regression testing - it's caught so many potential issues before they made it to production. It's especially important in fintech, right? You can't afford to have bugs in systems that handle people's money."
## "Tell me about your experience with event-driven architectures."
Answer:
"At IBM Research Africa, we were working on this really interesting distributed system. We used AWS SQS for our message queues, and it was fascinating to see how everything worked together. We had to handle failed jobs gracefully, so we set up dead-letter queues. The cool part was watching how the system could handle different loads without breaking a sweat. It's actually quite similar to what you'd need for real-time credit scoring - you need to process a lot of events quickly and reliably."
## "How do you stay current with new technologies?"
Answer:
"I'm always trying to learn new things. I follow a few tech newsletters, participate in online communities, and try to dedicate some time each week to learning something new. Recently, I got really into serverless architecture at Microsoft. I created a proof of concept that showed how we could reduce costs by 40% while improving scalability. The team was skeptical at first, but when they saw the results, they were really excited. I ended up running a workshop to share what I'd learned. It's important to keep learning, especially in fintech where new technologies can really make a difference."
## "Why are you interested in Wabeh?"
"You know what really gets me excited about Wabeh? It's like the perfect mix of everything I love doing. I've built fintech systems at Umati Capital, scaled platforms for millions at Microsoft, and I totally geek out about financial inclusion. Plus, with my CPA and MBA background, I get both the tech side and the business impact. When I saw what you're doing - using tech to help more people access financial services - I was like 'Yes, this is exactly what I want to be working on!' It's not just about building cool tech, it's about making a real difference in people's lives."

## Why are you leaving MS
You know, Microsoft has been an amazing journey - I've worked with brilliant people and tackled some really complex challenges. But I've always been passionate about fintech and its power to create positive change. During my time at Umati Capital, I saw firsthand how technology could open up financial opportunities for people who were previously excluded.

That's what excites me about this role. It's a chance to blend my technical skills from Microsoft with my finance background and build something that could really help people. While I'm grateful for my time at Microsoft, I'm ready to get back to creating solutions that directly impact financial inclusion. I think Wabeh offers exactly that kind of opportunity.

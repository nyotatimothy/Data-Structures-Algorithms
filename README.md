# Common DSA Interview Patterns

Here are some common patterns that can help you ace data structures and algorithms (DSA) interviews:

## 1. Sliding Window
- Used for problems involving subarrays or substrings
- Efficiently find a subarray that meets certain criteria

## 2. Two Pointers
- Useful for problems involving sorted arrays or linked lists
- Helps in finding pairs or reversing elements

## 3. Fast and Slow Pointers
- Detect cycles in linked lists or arrays
- Useful for finding the middle of a list

## 4. Merge Intervals
- Solve problems involving overlapping intervals
- Common in scheduling and calendar problems

## 5. Cyclic Sort
- Sort numbers when they are in a known range
- Useful for finding missing numbers

## 6. In-place Reversal of a Linked List
- Reverse linked lists or sublists
- Useful for palindrome checks

## 7. Tree Traversals
- Preorder, Inorder, Postorder, Level-order
- Solve problems involving binary trees

## 8. Graph Traversals
- Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Useful for connectivity and pathfinding problems

## 9. Topological Sort
- Order tasks given dependencies
- Common in scheduling problems

## 10. Binary Search
- Efficiently find elements in sorted arrays
- Useful for optimization problems

## 11. Dynamic Programming
- Solve problems by breaking them into subproblems
- Common in optimization and decision-making problems

## 12. Backtracking
- Explore all possible solutions
- Useful for constraint satisfaction problems like Sudoku

## 13. Greedy Algorithms
- Make the locally optimal choice at each step
- Useful for problems like interval scheduling

## 14. Bit Manipulation
- Solve problems using bitwise operations
- Useful for optimization and encoding problems

## 15. Union-Find
- Solve connectivity problems in graphs
- Useful for network connectivity and clustering

These patterns cover a wide range of problems and can be adapted to solve many interview questions. Understanding these patterns and practicing problems related to them can significantly improve your problem-solving skills.

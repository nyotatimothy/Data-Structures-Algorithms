    <div class="letter-content">
        <div class="paragraph">
            Dear JUMO Hiring Team,
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Software Engineer position at JUMO. With over 10 years of experience <span class="highlight">architecting and delivering highly scalable distributed systems</span>, I am particularly drawn to JUMO's mission of enabling equal access to finance opportunities through innovative technology. Having co-founded a fintech startup and worked extensively with major banks across Kenya, I understand the transformative power of banking as a service platforms in democratizing financial access. My proven track record in <span class="highlight">solving complex technical problems with scalable, testable, and maintainable solutions</span> aligns perfectly with the senior-level responsibilities outlined in this role.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            My technical background aligns perfectly with JUMO's modern tech stack. I have extensive experience with <span class="highlight">Java, Kotlin, Python, and Scala</span>, having led teams using these technologies at Ringier Africa and in my startup journey. My expertise in <span class="highlight">cloud infrastructure spans both AWS and Azure</span>, with hands-on experience in Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and Azure DevOps. I am well-versed in <span class="highlight">TypeScript and React</span> for frontend development, and have built scalable microservices architectures that handle high-volume, low-latency requirements.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            What sets me apart is my proven track record in building <span class="highlight">high-volume, low-latency financial services</span>. At Meliora Technologies, I architected and scaled the Tiara SMS Gateway from 1M to over 80M monthly transactions with 99.99% uptime, serving 12+ major Kenyan banks including KCB. This experience involved real-time financial transaction notifications, distributed system design, and integration with multiple mobile network operatorsâ€”skills directly applicable to JUMO's banking platform challenges. At IBM Research, I scaled microservices from 50 to 200+ services while maintaining sub-100ms response times, demonstrating my ability to build and maintain highly scalable distributed systems.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            My business acumen, reinforced by my MBA and startup co-founder experience, enables me to understand both technical and operational perspectives. I have successfully managed relationships with enterprise clients, driven 300% revenue growth, and understand the operational awareness crucial for fintech success. My experience contributing to Loop by CBA's financial inclusion platform, where I optimized backend transactions for underbanked populations, directly aligns with JUMO's mission of expanding financial access.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            As a Senior Software Engineer, I excel at the strategic responsibilities this role demands. I have extensive experience <span class="highlight">architecting services and systems using well-accepted design patterns</span> that enable iterative, autonomous development and future scaling. My track record includes defining team roadmaps aligned with company vision, conducting comprehensive code reviews, and guiding teams to consistently write production-ready code that accounts for edge cases and errors. I proactively anticipate and communicate blockers, delays, and cost implications before they require escalation, while driving best practices and contributing to technical documentation that elevates engineering standards.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            I am particularly excited about JUMO's commitment to <span class="highlight">Agile cross-functional teams and engineering excellence</span>. My experience leading teams of 12+ engineers, implementing CI/CD pipelines that reduced release cycles from 2 weeks to 2 days, and achieving 95% test coverage demonstrates my dedication to quality and efficiency. My published research papers and technology patents showcase my commitment to innovation, while my mentoring of 50+ participants across multiple hackathons reflects my passion for collaborative growth and developing junior colleagues as professionals.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Working in Kenya and having experience with diverse international teams at Microsoft and IBM, I am well-positioned to contribute to JUMO's remote-first culture spanning UTC to UTC+3 time zones. My communication skills, demonstrated through technical leadership, research publications, and cross-functional collaboration, will enable me to thrive in your inclusive, innovative environment.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to JUMO's mission of transforming financial access across Africa. My combination of technical expertise in your exact tech stack, proven experience with high-volume financial platforms, and passion for building scalable systems that create real-world impact makes me an ideal candidate for this role.
        </div>

        <div class="closing">
            <div class="paragraph">
                Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my experience can contribute to JUMO's continued success in building market-leading banking as a service platforms.
            </div>

            <div class="paragraph">
                Sincerely,
            </div>

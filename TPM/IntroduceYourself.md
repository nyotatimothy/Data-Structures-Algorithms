# Introduction

I'm Timothy, currently a Software Engineer at Microsoft in Nairobi where I lead the passwordless sign-in feature and collaborate on Authentication User experiences work. Before Microsoft, I was a Research Engineer at IBM Research Africa where I served as product owner for the eMaji water management platform and led development of the COVID-19 countermeasures dashboard, which was crucial during the pandemic.

Throughout my career, I've developed strong skills in engineering, cross-functional collaboration, and building solutions that impact millions of users. I've also contributed to three patents and several research publications in applied technology.

I'm looking to leverage my experience in both engineering and product ownership to make a greater impact as a Technical Program Manager.

# Why TPM?

I'm looking to leverage my experience in both engineering and product ownership to make a greater impact as a Technical Program Manager.

You know, after several years as a software engineer, I've realized my favorite parts of the job aren't just writing code – they're the parts where I get to connect the dots between teams and help drive projects forward.

I've often found myself naturally taking on coordination roles in my projects, helping to break down technical problems, identify dependencies, and keep everyone aligned. I really enjoy seeing the bigger picture of how all the pieces fit together across teams and systems.

As an engineer, I've been on the receiving end of both great and not-so-great program management, and I've seen firsthand how crucial that role is to a project's success. When requirements are clear, dependencies are identified early, and everyone knows what they're responsible for, it's amazing how smoothly things can go.

I'm looking to transition to TPM because I want to leverage my technical background to help teams collaborate more effectively. I think having been in the engineer's shoes gives me a valuable perspective – I understand the technical constraints, can speak the same language, and know when to push and when something genuinely needs more time.

Ultimately, I'm excited about being able to drive larger initiatives and have a broader impact across the organization while still applying my technical knowledge. I see it as a natural evolution that plays to my strengths in both technical understanding and cross-team collaboration.


# How have you used TPM skills thus far

One that's been particularly valuable is cross-functional alignment. While working on the passwordless sign-in feature at Microsoft, I had to coordinate between UX designers, security experts, and backend teams. I noticed I was often the one creating shared understanding between these groups, translating security requirements into UX considerations, for example.

Documentation and specification writing has been another unexpected strength. When I created the roadmap and spec docs for the passwordless feature, I found I actually enjoyed the process of breaking down complex technical concepts into clear requirements and deliverables.

Dependency management has been crucial too. At IBM, when working on the COVID-19 countermeasures dashboard, we had tight deadlines and multiple data sources. I naturally gravitated toward mapping out dependencies between different work streams to ensure everyone knew what they needed from each other and when.

Risk identification is something I've developed a good sense for. I've learned to spot potential issues early and bring them up proactively - like when I realized the deployment cadence for a project was going to be a bottleneck and worked with my manager to implement flexible deployments.

Finally, serving as product owner for the eMaji platform at IBM really taught me how to balance technical constraints with user needs and business goals, which I understand is a core TPM skill.
These experiences have shown me that while I enjoy coding, I find even more satisfaction in the orchestration aspects of delivering complex technical projects.

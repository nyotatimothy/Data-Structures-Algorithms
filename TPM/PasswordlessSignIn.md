# Passwordless Sign-in Feature Enhancement

Oh, absolutely! So I led a project to enhance the passwordless sign-in feature for Microsoft accounts. This was an interesting challenge that really stretched my skills beyond just coding and gave me exposure to the kind of cross-functional work that TPMs do every day.

## The Problem
We discovered a critical gap in our security monitoring. When users attempted a passwordless sign-in but denied the authentication, those denial events weren't showing up in the Microsoft Account Activity Page. This was a serious security concern because users couldn't see potentially unauthorized access attempts.

After investigating, we found the root cause was a malformed data object being sent to the activity logging service. The API expected a specific format, but our client was sending a slightly different structure that caused these events to be dropped silently.

## Stakeholder Engagement
This wasn't something I could fix in isolation. I needed to coordinate across several teams:

First, I set up meetings with the product managers to understand the user impact and prioritization. They helped clarify the business requirements - specifically what information needed to be visible to users in the activity log.

Then I engaged with the API owners of the Account Activity service. This was interesting because they initially pushed back, suggesting our client should just conform to their existing API. I had to negotiate a path forward by showing data on how many denial events were being missed and the security implications.

I also worked closely with the UX team to design how these denial events would appear in the activity log. We needed to make it clear to users what had happened without causing unnecessary alarm.

## Solution Approach
We decided on a phased approach:

1. First, I fixed the client-side code to correctly format the object being sent to the API.
2. The API team agreed to add additional validation and error responses rather than silently dropping malformed requests.
3. We collaborated with the UX team to update the activity page to show these events in a user-friendly way, with clear explanations about what a denied passwordless attempt means.

I created a project timeline with clear dependencies and milestones, which helped everyone understand what was needed from them and when.

## Implementation Details
The technical implementation involved updating our authentication flows to properly capture and format denial events. I worked with our security team to ensure we were logging the right amount of information - enough to be useful for identifying unauthorized attempts but not so much that we created privacy concerns.

We added location data, device information, application details, and timestamps to give users a complete picture of each sign-in attempt.

## Testing and Monitoring
This is where my engineering background really helped. I developed comprehensive unit tests to ensure the data objects were always correctly formatted. But I also went beyond that:

I created end-to-end test scenarios that mimicked real-world usage patterns - sign-in attempts from different locations, various devices, and multiple applications.

For monitoring, I implemented custom logging and set up dashboards to track:
- The volume of denied passwordless attempts
- Success rate of logging these events to the activity page
- Any errors or exceptions in the process

I also worked with our support team to track any related customer issues to make sure our solution was working as expected in production.

## Results and Impact
After deployment, we saw a 100% improvement in the visibility of denied authentication attempts. Users could now see all passwordless sign-in attempts in their activity log, including who or what tried to access their account, when, from where, and on what device.

This enhanced security visibility for millions of Microsoft account users and gave them greater control over their account security.

The project taught me a lot about managing cross-team dependencies and navigating technical disagreements - skills that I believe will serve me well as a TPM. I'm particularly proud of how I was able to bring together different stakeholders with competing priorities and guide everyone toward a solution that worked for all teams while prioritizing user security.

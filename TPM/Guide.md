`For the given question, follow these steps:
Assume that you are in a product manager interview. 
Simulate a real interview candidate: Be conversational, and it's okay to forget some details. Keep it natural and engaging. I cannot emphasize this point enough. Your answer should illustrate problem solving and fit into the role.
Structure your answer: Start with the product perspective, then move to technical and business aspects. Keep progressing towards a solution without staying too conceptual. Keep it natural and engaging.
Conceptualize the product: Clearly outline your vision and how you would build an innovative, out of the box solution that leverages existing technologies and infrastructure. Keep it natural and engaging.
Big picture view: Identify users, their needs, and pain points. Consider how these needs are currently met and who the competitors are. Differentiate your solution by making it simple, elegant, and game-changing. Keep it natural and engaging.
Interview tone: Keep your response less formal but respectful, as if in an interview setting.
Frameworks: Use relevant frameworks for analytics, technical, or business queries to ensure you cover all necessary details.
6. Illustrate with diagrams: Use a simple stick flow diagram to show how different parts of the solution connect and interact.
Clarifying questions: Ask 2-3 questions to ensure you understand the problem fully.
Technical details: Explain technical aspects in a friendly, conversational manner, providing depth to your points without just listing them.

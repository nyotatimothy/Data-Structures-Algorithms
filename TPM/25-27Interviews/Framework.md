# STAR-P Framework for Interview Questions

This framework builds on the classic STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) with an added "P" for personal learning or principles that makes it particularly effective for technical program management interviews.

## The STAR-P Framework

### S - Situation
- Set the context with a specific, relevant example from your experience
- Keep it concise (2-3 sentences) but include enough detail to show complexity
- Focus on situations that demonstrate your TPM capabilities (cross-team coordination, technical challenges, etc.)

### T - Task
- Clearly explain your specific responsibilities and objectives
- Highlight your role and ownership
- Connect to skills relevant for the Windows App Compatibility TPM role (project management, technical understanding, stakeholder alignment)

### A - Action
- Describe the specific steps you took (this should be the longest part)
- Emphasize TPM skills like:
  - How you facilitated collaboration
  - Technical approaches you recommended
  - How you managed stakeholders with competing priorities
  - Methods for tracking progress and ensuring accountability
  - How you removed obstacles
- Use "I" statements to clarify your personal contributions while acknowledging team efforts

### R - Results
- Quantify outcomes whenever possible (percentages, time saved, user impact)
- Include both technical and business impacts
- Mention any recognition or positive feedback received
- If the outcome wasn't ideal, explain what you learned and how you'd approach it differently

### P - Principles/Personal Learning
- Share insights gained from the experience
- Connect to broader principles of effective program management
- Demonstrate growth mindset and continuous learning
- Relate to how this experience would help you succeed in the Windows App Compatibility role

## Applying the Framework: Quick Reference Guide

### For Technical Problem-Solving Questions:
- Situation: Technical challenge encountered (compatibility issues, data processing problems)
- Task: Your specific responsibility in addressing it
- Action: Your methodical approach (problem breakdown, stakeholder involvement, technical investigation)
- Result: Technical outcome and business impact
- Principles: Technical insights gained, approach to balancing technical debt vs. delivery

### For Collaboration Questions:
- Situation: Cross-team project or initiative
- Task: Your role in facilitating collaboration
- Action: Specific techniques used (communication structures, alignment techniques)
- Result: How improved collaboration led to better outcomes
- Principles: Key insights about effective cross-team dynamics

### For Project Management Questions:
- Situation: Complex project with multiple stakeholders
- Task: Your program management responsibilities
- Action: Planning, tracking, risk management approaches
- Result: On-time delivery, quality metrics, stakeholder satisfaction
- Principles: Project management principles that proved effective

### For Change Management Questions:
- Situation: Significant change initiative (process, technology, organization)
- Task: Your role in facilitating the change
- Action: How you managed resistance, communication, training
- Result: Adoption metrics, efficiency gains
- Principles: Change management insights gained

## Example Application (Condensed)

**Question: Tell me about a time you led a cross-functional project with technical complexity.**

**Situation:** "During the MISE dSTS App Compliance Project, we needed to identify non-compliant security applications across Microsoft. The data was stored in complex Parquet files in Azure Data Lake that needed to be processed and integrated with our dashboard system."

**Task:** "As the technical lead, I was responsible for designing the data processing solution and coordinating work across five different teams - data engineering, application platform, security compliance, UX, and the dashboard team."

**Action:** "I began by conducting technical discovery sessions to understand the data structure. Then I created a phased implementation plan that broke the complex problem into manageable components. I established a cross-functional working group with weekly syncs and a shared Teams channel for ongoing collaboration. When we hit deployment bottlenecks, I advocated for and implemented flexible deployments, reducing deployment time from 2 weeks to just hours."

**Result:** "We successfully delivered a solution that identified all non-compliant apps, with clear guidance on remediation steps. Within three months, we saw a 40% reduction in non-compliant applications. The flexible deployment approach I championed became a standard practice for the team."

**Principles:** "This experience reinforced that technical program management isn't just about managing tasks - it's about creating the right environment for collaboration while maintaining technical depth. I learned that breaking complex problems into smaller components with clear ownership is essential for cross-team initiatives."

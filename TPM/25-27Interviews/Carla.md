## SFI Project 

I led a project to identify MISE security-vulnerable authentication applications across Microsoft by creating a system that processed compliance data from Azure Data Lake and surfaced actionable insights on our s360 dashboard.

 The technical challenge involved building a complex data pipeline using a Microsoft internal tool called Intelligent Data Experiences (IDE) to extract, transform and integrate compliance data that was previously inaccessible to application owners. 

## Passwordless Sign In

I worked on a security enhancement project for Microsoft's passwordless authentication system that addressed a critical gap where denied sign-in attempts weren't visible to users in their Account Activity Page. 

The challenge involved fixing a data formatting issue between our client and the activity logging service while coordinating across four teams—product management, API owners, UX, and security. 

I implemented a phased solution that corrected the client-side data formatting, improved API validation to prevent silent failures, and enhanced the activity page with user-friendly visualizations of denied attempts. Through comprehensive testing and monitoring, we achieved 100% improvement in security visibility, allowing millions of users to see all passwordless sign-in attempts—including potentially unauthorized ones—with detailed information about device, location, and application.

This significantly improved our security posture by enabling users to identify and respond to suspicious access attempts.

### Question 1: Tell me about a time when you had to collaborate with multiple teams to solve a complex problem.

In my work on the MISE dSTS App Compliance Project, I faced a situation where we needed to identify and flag non-compliant applications that posed security risks, but the data was stored in a format we didn't typically work with (Parquet files in Azure Data Lake).

I recognized that this required coordination across multiple teams, so I established a cross-functional working group with representatives from the MISE team (data owners), my engineering team, product managers, and dSTS subject matter experts.

When I discovered the initial requirements were incomplete, I didn't just send back questions - I organized a meeting with all stakeholders to clarify expectations and in this way, we prevented misalignment later in the project.

For the technical solution, I proposed using IDX (built on Azure Synapse Analytics) after researching various options. I led a proof-of-concept effort to validate this approach before committing the full team.

What made this collaboration successful was creating clear ownership and communication channels. I developed a detailed work breakdown structure and strategically assigned tasks based on team members' expertise. Additionally, I identified deployment cadence as a major bottleneck and collaborated with my manager to make a case for moving to flexible deployments, which reduced deployment time from 2 weeks to just hours.

The result was a solution that gave application owners visibility into compliance issues that were previously hidden, leading to a 40% reduction in non-compliant apps within three months.

### Question 2: How do you handle stakeholders with competing priorities?

During the Passwordless Sign-in Feature Enhancement project, I encountered competing priorities among different stakeholders. The API owners initially pushed back on making changes, suggesting our client should simply conform to their existing API. Meanwhile, the product managers were concerned about user experience and security implications, and the UX team had their own vision for how denial events should appear.

My approach was to:
- Focus on data and user impact: I gathered data showing how many denial events were being missed and the security implications. This helped shift the conversation from "who needs to change" to "what's best for our users."
- Find compromise solutions: Rather than forcing either side to completely change, we decided on a phased approach where my team would fix the client-side formatting, while the API team agreed to add validation and error responses instead of silently dropping requests.
- Create a clear timeline with dependencies: I developed a project timeline that helped everyone understand what was needed from them and when, making the interdependencies visible to all stakeholders.
- Facilitate direct communication: I brought competing stakeholders together in focused discussions rather than acting as a go-between, which helped build mutual understanding.

The result was a solution that worked for all teams while prioritizing user security. We achieved 100% improvement in the visibility of denied authentication attempts, enhancing security visibility for millions of Microsoft account users.

### Question 3: How do you ensure effective communication when working with technical and non-technical stakeholders?

In the MISE dSTS App Compliance Project, I worked with both highly technical teams (engineers working with IDX and data pipelines) and less technical stakeholders (content writers and some product managers who needed to understand the compliance issues).

My approach to bridging this gap was:
- Tailor the communication style: With technical teams, I could dive into details about data schemas and pipeline architecture. With non-technical stakeholders, I focused on impact and outcomes, using visualizations and analogies.
- Create shared artifacts: I worked with the MISE team to update PowerBI dashboards with visualizations showing compliance status, trends over time, and specific issues. These dashboards served as a common reference point that both technical and non-technical stakeholders could understand.
- Translate between domains: When engineering teams raised technical concerns, I translated those into business implications for the product teams. Similarly, when product teams had requirements, I worked to express those in technical terms for the implementation teams.
- Regular check-ins with different formats: I established weekly sync meetings for technical updates but also held separate sessions focused on product requirements and user experience. This allowed stakeholders to engage in the format most relevant to their role.

This approach ensured everyone stayed aligned throughout the project, even though they came from different backgrounds and had different primary concerns.

### Question 4: Describe a situation where you had to influence without authority to drive collaboration.

During the Passwordless Sign-in Enhancement project, I needed to convince the API owners to modify their service, despite having no direct authority over their team. They initially pushed back, suggesting our client should just conform to their existing API.

I approached this situation by:
- Building a compelling case: I gathered data showing the volume of denied authentication attempts that weren't being logged and visualized the security gap this created for users. This transformed the conversation from a technical preference to a user security issue.
- Understanding their constraints: Rather than just pushing my agenda, I took time to understand the API team's concerns about changing their service. They were worried about backward compatibility and their already-packed roadmap.
- Proposing a win-win solution: Instead of asking for a complete API overhaul, I suggested adding validation and error responses, which would be less disruptive to their existing service while still meeting our needs.
- Involving leadership appropriately: When we needed to prioritize this work, I prepared a concise summary of the user impact and security implications, which helped when escalating to leadership for prioritization decisions.
- Building relationships: Throughout the project, I invested in building good working relationships with the API team, recognizing their expertise and involving them early in discussions rather than presenting finished solutions.

The result was successful collaboration where the API team not only made the necessary changes but became advocates for the improved security monitoring. This experience taught me that influence comes from combining data-driven arguments with genuine relationship building and understanding of other teams' constraints.


### Question 5: How do you approach bringing together teams that don't typically work with each other?

Oh, this is something I dealt with directly in the MISE compliance project! We had the data team who owned all the compliance information, and then our engineering team who needed to build the solution, but they honestly spoke different languages.

What I found works really well is starting with a "translation session." I basically sat down with the data folks first and had them walk me through their world - how they structured their data, what the business rules meant, all of that. I asked a ton of questions until I really understood it myself.

Then, instead of just forwarding documents to my engineering team, I organized what I call a "technical handshake" meeting. In this meeting, I started by explaining the business problem in terms engineers care about, then had the data team present their structure, but I jumped in whenever I saw confusion on either side.

The key was creating this shared vocabulary. For example, what the data team called "non-compliant apps," our team was thinking about as "flagged entities in the dashboard." Once we aligned on terminology, collaboration became so much smoother.

I also found it helpful to create joint working sessions rather than formal meetings. We set up a Teams channel where both groups could post questions and screenshots in real-time. This broke down the formality and got people comfortable reaching out directly to each other.

By the end of the project, these teams that hadn't really worked together before had built this mutual respect, and they actually started collaborating on other initiatives without me needing to facilitate. That was pretty rewarding to see!

### Question 6: Tell me about a time when a collaboration wasn't going well. How did you turn it around?

So during the passwordless sign-in project, we hit a real rough patch with the API team. We were about six weeks in, and there was this growing tension between our client team and their API service team. They were basically pointing fingers at each other - our team saying "your API is dropping our events" and their team saying "you're sending malformed data."

The email chains were getting longer, meetings were getting tense, and progress completely stalled. I could see this was headed in a bad direction.

What I did was actually pretty simple but effective. I called the tech lead from the API team and just said, "Hey, can we grab a virtual coffee, just you and me?" No agenda, no managers, just a conversation. During that chat, I learned he was under enormous pressure from other high-priority projects and saw our requests as adding to his team's workload.

With that context, I suggested we take a different approach. Instead of more meetings with the whole teams, I proposed we create a small "tiger team" - just one engineer from each side plus me. We set up a four-hour working session where we literally traced the data flow together, looking at logs and message formats.

The breakthrough came when we discovered both teams were partially right - we were sending data in a slightly off format, but their API was also silently dropping it instead of returning errors. Once we had this shared understanding, the finger-pointing stopped.

I then helped draft a simple one-pager showing what each team would change and why, which made it clear this was a collaborative fix rather than one team "giving in." The teams actually became allies after this because they'd solved something together.

The lesson I learned is that sometimes you need to reset the dynamics completely rather than trying to push through established patterns that aren't working.

### Question 7: How do you balance keeping everyone informed while not overwhelming people with too much communication?

That's such a practical question! At Microsoft, we're drowning in emails and Teams messages, right? During the MISE compliance project, I was coordinating across five different teams, and I quickly realized that if I copied everyone on everything, people would just tune out.

My approach evolved into what I call "layered communication." Here's how it worked:

For the core working team, I set up a Teams channel with daily standups that took literally two minutes - just blockers and needs. This kept the day-to-day work flowing.

For broader stakeholders, I created a weekly status email with a super consistent format: green/yellow/red status, key accomplishments, blockers, and next steps. The email was designed so you could get the gist in 30 seconds, but could dive deeper if you wanted to.

Then for leadership, I set up bi-weekly 15-minute touchpoints with a simple PowerPoint that focused on business impact and major decision points - not implementation details.

The game-changer was creating a SharePoint dashboard that anyone could check anytime. It showed our burndown chart, key metrics, and current focus areas. This meant I could tell people "it's on the dashboard" rather than sending updates, and they appreciated being able to pull information when they needed it.

I also learned to be really thoughtful about meeting invites. For each meeting, I'd ask myself, "Does this person need to shape the decision, or just be informed of the outcome?" If it was the latter, I'd send them the notes afterward instead of adding another meeting to their calendar.

People actually thanked me for being respectful of their time, and I found I got better engagement because folks weren't feeling overwhelmed by the collaboration.

### Question 8: Give an example of how you've leveraged different perspectives to improve a solution.

In the passwordless sign-in project, we initially approached it purely as a technical bug fix. From our engineering lens, we just needed to correct the data format being sent to the logging service. Simple enough, right?

But as I started talking with different teams, I realized how narrow our initial view was. When I met with the security team, they pointed out that we needed to carefully consider what information we logged - too little wouldn't help users identify unauthorized attempts, but too much could create privacy concerns.

Then the support team brought up something completely different - they were getting calls from confused users who saw authentication activities but didn't understand what they meant. So it wasn't just about logging the events; it was about making them comprehensible.

The UX team had yet another perspective - they were concerned about creating unnecessary alarm. They pointed out that if we suddenly started showing users all these denied authentication attempts without proper context, people might think they were under attack when it could just be automated systems or harmless events.

What I did was bring all these perspectives together in a design workshop. Instead of having our engineering team just implement the logging fix, we co-created the solution with input from all these viewpoints.

The end result was so much better than our initial idea. We implemented a fix that not only logged the right amount of information but also displayed it with helpful context about the device, application, and location. We added user-friendly explanations about what different types of denied attempts might mean, and we even created a severity indicator to help users distinguish between concerning and routine events.

What I learned is that technical solutions often have human dimensions that we miss when we stay in our own bubble. By bringing in these different lenses, we ended up with something that was not just technically correct but actually useful and accessible to users.


### Question 9: How do you handle disagreements in cross-functional teams?

You know, this came up in a really interesting way during the dSTS compliance project. We had this situation where the engineering team wanted to build a complex, highly automated solution for flagging non-compliant apps. They were excited about using all these advanced Azure Synapse features. Meanwhile, the product team was pushing for a simpler implementation that could ship faster, even if it meant more manual steps for users.

These were both valid perspectives, and the discussions were getting pretty heated in meetings. Rather than just letting them argue or making an executive decision, I tried something different.

First, I scheduled separate coffees with the tech lead and the product manager to understand their underlying concerns. The engineering team was worried about technical debt and scalability, while the PM was focused on meeting quarterly goals and user feedback about needing this feature urgently.

Then, instead of more debates, I facilitated a session where I had both sides list out their non-negotiables versus their preferences. This shifted the conversation from "my solution versus yours" to identifying the core requirements we all agreed on.

What we landed on was actually a phased approach. We'd implement the PM's simpler solution first to meet the urgent need, but we'd architect it in a way that allowed us to build toward the engineering team's vision in the next quarter. I also helped create a roadmap showing how the initial solution would evolve, which gave the engineering team confidence that we weren't just accumulating technical debt.

The disagreement actually led to a better outcome because we got the best of both worlds - timely delivery plus a path to the right long-term solution. I've found that most disagreements in tech aren't about right versus wrong, but about different priorities and constraints, and recognizing that changes how you approach resolution.

### Question 10: Tell me about a time when you had to bring a team back on track after falling behind schedule.

Oh man, this happened with the passwordless sign-in project. We had this critical security feature with a fixed ship date tied to a broader security announcement, but about halfway through we realized we were seriously behind schedule.

The first thing I did was call an honest "state of the union" meeting. No finger-pointing, just a candid assessment of where we were versus where we needed to be. I think people appreciated that I didn't sugar-coat it or pretend everything was fine.

Then we did a rapid reprioritization exercise. I brought in a whiteboard (virtually, since we were remote) and we mapped out what was absolutely needed for launch versus what could be shipped in a follow-up release. This was tough because engineers are perfectionists at heart - they wanted to implement everything properly. But I kept focusing the conversation on "what will meaningfully improve user security now?"

We identified that the core logging functionality was essential, but some of the fancy filtering and categorization features could wait. We also found a few areas where we could simplify the implementation without compromising the security benefits.

The next step was to remove roadblocks. I noticed our team was spending hours each week waiting for test environment deployments. So I worked with our DevOps team to create a dedicated pipeline that reduced deployment time from 24 hours to just 2 hours. This seemingly small change dramatically increased our iteration speed.

I also implemented daily stand-ups - super short, just 10 minutes - to quickly identify any new blockers. If issues came up that needed deeper discussion, we'd take them offline with just the relevant people rather than derailing the whole team.

The other thing that really helped was celebrating small wins. When a team is behind, morale can tank. So I made sure to call out progress and victories, even small ones, to keep everyone motivated.

We ended up making the ship date - not with everything we'd originally planned, but with the security-critical features intact. And having gone through this crunch together actually brought the team closer. We had a much more streamlined process for the follow-up release, which went much smoother.

### Question 11: How do you approach knowledge sharing across teams?

This is something I've become really passionate about, especially after the MISE project where we were working with this specialized authentication technology that not many people understood deeply.

I realized early on that if knowledge stayed siloed with just a few experts, we'd always have bottlenecks. So I took a multi-layered approach to knowledge sharing.

For immediate needs, I set up what I called "expert office hours" - specific times when the dSTS specialists would be available in a Teams channel to answer questions from anyone working on the project. This was way more efficient than having people wait for email responses or schedule formal meetings.

For broader understanding, I organized a series of lunch-and-learns. But here's the twist - instead of just having the experts present, I had them pair with someone from another team who was learning the technology. They'd co-present, with the expert handling the deep dive and the learner explaining their journey to understanding. This was incredibly effective because the learner knew which aspects were confusing and needed more explanation.

I also pushed for better documentation, but with a practical approach. Rather than asking already busy engineers to write comprehensive docs, we recorded key troubleshooting sessions and technical discussions (with permission). These recordings became an amazing resource that new team members could reference.

For the longer term, I implemented a "knowledge transfer checklist" for the project. Before considering any major component done, the primary engineer had to pair with someone from another team for at least one working session. This created organic cross-pollination of ideas and expertise.

What I learned is that knowledge sharing isn't just about documentation or formal training. It's about creating multiple pathways for information to flow naturally between teams. And the side benefit was that as knowledge spread, we got more diverse perspectives on our technical challenges, which actually led to more innovative solutions.

### Question 12: How do you make sure remote or distributed team members feel included in collaboration?

This became super relevant during the pandemic when our entire authentication team suddenly went remote. But even before that, we had team members in different offices, so I'd been thinking about this challenge.

One thing I implemented was a "distributed-first" mentality. Even if several people were in the same room and only one person was remote, we'd all join the meeting from our individual laptops. This created a level playing field where no one was struggling to hear side conversations or see what was being written on a physical whiteboard.

I also became much more intentional about meeting structures. I'd send agendas in advance so people in different time zones could contribute thoughts beforehand if they couldn't attend. During meetings, I'd actively call on remote folks first, knowing that it's harder to find the right moment to jump into a conversation when you're not physically present.

For asynchronous collaboration, we started using digital whiteboards like Miro, where everyone could contribute ideas visually, regardless of location. I found this actually increased participation from some of the quieter team members who might not speak up as much in live meetings.

The social element is important too. For the MISE project, we had a weekly "virtual coffee" with no agenda - just connecting as humans. I'd occasionally send small care packages to team members, especially when someone had been putting in extra hours or hit a big milestone.

One technique that worked surprisingly well was creating "buddies" across different locations. I'd pair people who needed to collaborate frequently, and they'd have a standing 15-minute check-in a few times a week. These buddy relationships often evolved into strong working partnerships where people felt comfortable pinging each other for quick questions.

The key insight I had was that inclusion for distributed teams doesn't happen by accident - you have to deliberately design your collaboration practices with remote members in mind. When we did this well, we actually found that location became almost irrelevant to how effectively people could contribute.


### Question 13: How do you approach collaborating with teams that have different working styles or processes?

This was a real challenge during the MISE compliance project because we were essentially bridging two very different worlds. The MISE team operated in two-week sprints with very structured processes, while our data platform team had a more fluid approach where they'd work on multiple initiatives simultaneously.

At first, this created some friction. The MISE team would expect commitments for specific deliverables every two weeks, but our data team wasn't accustomed to breaking down their work that way.

Instead of forcing either team to completely change their style, I created what I called a "collaboration bridge." I worked with the data team lead to identify milestone deliverables that aligned with their working style but could also fit into the MISE team's sprint schedule. We basically created a translation layer between the two processes.

For planning meetings, I'd have pre-meetings with each team in their preferred format. With the MISE team, we'd use their structured backlog grooming approach. With the data team, we'd have more exploratory technical discussions. Then I'd synthesize these into shared goals that respected both working styles.

I also found it helpful to be transparent about these differences rather than pretending they didn't exist. In one of our cross-team kickoffs, I actually had both leads talk about how their teams preferred to work and what usually tripped them up when working with others. This created mutual understanding and some good laughs as people recognized their own quirks.

The result wasn't perfect harmony – there were still occasional disconnects – but by acknowledging the different styles and creating deliberate connection points, we established enough common ground to collaborate effectively. And interestingly, both teams actually adopted some practices from each other by the end of the project!

### Question 14: Describe how you've used data to improve collaboration on a project.

You know, I used to think of collaboration as this purely interpersonal thing, but during the passwordless sign-in project, I discovered how powerful data could be for bringing teams together.

We were having these circular debates about how to prioritize different aspects of the authentication experience. The security team wanted to maximize protection, the user experience team was focused on simplicity, and the mobile team was concerned about performance on devices.

Instead of continuing these theoretical debates, I suggested we gather some actual data. We set up a simple telemetry experiment that measured how users interacted with the current authentication flow, including how many abandoned the process at different stages.

The findings were eye-opening. We discovered that users were abandoning the passwordless sign-in attempt at much higher rates on certain types of devices and in certain network conditions. This completely shifted our conversation from abstract preferences to solving real user problems.

With this data in hand, I created visual dashboards that all teams could access, showing abandonment rates, authentication completion times, and error rates across different scenarios. This became our shared reference point in discussions.

The magic happened when we started using this data in our cross-team meetings. Instead of "I think users want X" or "My team believes Y is important," the conversation shifted to "The data shows users are struggling with Z." This created a much more objective basis for collaboration.

I also used the data to create a shared prioritization framework. We agreed as a group to weight issues based on 1) number of users affected, 2) security impact, and 3) abandonment rate. This gave us a consistent way to evaluate trade-offs that everyone had bought into.

What I learned is that good data becomes this neutral third party in cross-team discussions. It helps move conversations from subjective opinions to objective problem-solving, which is incredibly powerful for collaboration.

### Question 15: Tell me about a time when you had to adapt your collaboration approach due to changing circumstances.

Well, the biggest adaptation we all faced was when COVID hit, right? In the middle of the MISE compliance project, we suddenly went from hallway conversations and whiteboard sessions to everyone being remote. This was a huge shift for our collaboration model.

Initially, we tried to just move our existing meeting structure online, but it quickly became clear that sitting in 6-hour Zoom meetings wasn't going to work. People were getting exhausted, and the spontaneous creativity we had in person wasn't happening.

So I completely revamped our approach. First, I broke our long planning meetings into a series of focused 30-minute sessions spread across days, each with a specific decision to make. This kept energy levels higher and actually improved decision quality.

I also recognized that different team members were dealing with different home situations - some had kids at home, others had roommates, different internet reliability, you name it. So I created more flexibility in how people could contribute. For synchronous discussions, we'd use Teams, but I also set up asynchronous alternatives using shared documents where people could add thoughts over a 24-hour period.

Another big change was adding more structure to our communication. In the office, you could catch nuance and confusion in people's expressions, but that was harder remotely. So I started creating more detailed meeting prep materials and would follow up with documented decisions and action items within hours, not days.

I also got more intentional about relationship-building. I scheduled virtual coffee chats between team members who would normally have bumped into each other in the office. These informal connections proved crucial for maintaining the trust that collaboration depends on.

What surprised me was that some aspects of our collaboration actually improved. More people could participate since location wasn't a barrier, and we found that some of our quieter team members contributed more substantially in written formats than they had in noisy conference rooms.

The key lesson was that effective collaboration isn't about sticking to one approach - it's about being willing to experiment and adapt based on changing circumstances while keeping focused on the outcomes you're trying to achieve together.

### Question 16: How do you ensure accountability in collaborative projects without micromanaging?

Finding that balance between accountability and autonomy is tricky, isn't it? During the MISE compliance project, we had over 20 people involved across different teams, and keeping everyone aligned without becoming the "task police" was something I really had to work at.

What worked well was setting up what I call "visibility systems" rather than "reporting systems." The difference might sound subtle, but it had a huge impact on how people engaged.

For example, instead of asking for status updates in meetings where people felt put on the spot, I created a shared Teams channel with a simple status board. Team members would post their own updates when they completed milestones or hit obstacles. This shifted ownership to the team while maintaining visibility.

We also established clear team agreements upfront. Rather than me dictating how we'd work, we collectively decided on things like: "If you're going to miss a commitment, give at least 48 hours notice" and "No surprises in status meetings." Because the team created these guidelines together, there was more buy-in.

For tracking progress, I found that focusing on outcomes rather than activities made a huge difference. Instead of "Did you complete these 5 tasks?" the question became "Are we on track to meet this milestone, and what support do you need?" This gave people flexibility in how they approached their work while keeping accountability for results.

I also introduced a practice we called "blockers first" - at the start of any check-in, we'd go around and have people share any blockers before discussing progress. This created psychological safety where asking for help became normalized rather than seen as a failure.

When someone did miss a commitment, I'd have a private conversation focused on understanding rather than criticism. Often there were legitimate reasons or misaligned expectations, and addressing those constructively built trust rather than resentment.

What I've learned is that accountability works best when it's rooted in clarity and support rather than control. When people understand the "why" behind deadlines and commitments, and feel supported in meeting them, they're much more likely to hold themselves accountable than when they feel they're being monitored or doubted.


### Question 17: How do you navigate cultural differences when collaborating with global teams?

This actually became really relevant during the authentication services work because we were coordinating with teams in Redmond, India, and parts of Europe. The differences weren't just about time zones—there were subtle cultural variations in how people communicated and approached problems.

One thing I noticed early on was that our team in India was extremely polite in meetings and would rarely push back directly, even when they had concerns. Meanwhile, the Redmond team was very direct and sometimes came across as blunt. This created situations where it seemed like everyone was aligned in the meeting, but then implementation would go in different directions.

So I adjusted my approach in a few ways. For one, I started having pre-meetings with the teams in India where I explicitly asked for concerns in a more private setting. I found they were much more comfortable sharing potential issues when it wasn't in a large group setting. I could then bring these points up in the main meeting without putting anyone on the spot.

I also worked on creating more structured documentation and decision logs. Instead of relying on verbal agreements, which can be interpreted differently across cultures, we'd document exactly what was decided and share it afterward for confirmation. This gave everyone another opportunity to clarify their understanding.

For async communication, I became more thoughtful about my language. I realized that phrases like "Let's consider this approach" might be interpreted as a polite suggestion by some and a clear direction by others. So I started being more explicit: "I'm suggesting this as one option, but I'm open to alternatives if you see issues."

I also encouraged more video usage in our calls. Reading facial expressions and body language helped bridge some of the communication gaps. And I tried to rotate meeting times so the same region wasn't always having to join at inconvenient hours.

The most valuable practice, though, was creating explicit space for relationship building. I scheduled virtual team events focused on learning about each other's locations and backgrounds. Understanding more about different team members' contexts made it easier to appreciate where they were coming from in work discussions.

The result was a much more cohesive global team where different cultural perspectives actually strengthened our solutions rather than creating confusion. It took more intentional communication, but the diversity of thought was absolutely worth it.

### Question 18: Describe a time when you had to collaborate with someone who was difficult to work with.

During the passwordless sign-in project, I had to work closely with an engineer—let's call him Tom—who had a reputation for being difficult. He was technically brilliant but often dismissive of others' ideas and would sometimes respond to questions with sarcasm rather than helpful information.

At first, I tried what most people did—minimizing interactions with him and working around him when possible. But he was the key expert on the authentication API, so that approach wasn't sustainable.

So I decided to take a different tack. I scheduled a one-on-one coffee chat with him, not to discuss any specific work item, but just to get to know him better. During that conversation, I discovered that he was passionate about security architecture and had previously proposed improvements that weren't prioritized. I realized a lot of his frustration came from feeling that his expertise wasn't being valued.

With this insight, I changed how I engaged with him. Instead of just asking him implementation questions, I started seeking his input earlier in the design process. I'd say things like, "Before we get too far, I'd really value your perspective on the security implications of this approach." This small shift—treating him as a consultant rather than just an implementer—completely changed our dynamic.

I also found that he responded better to technical challenges than directive requests. Rather than saying "We need to implement this logging feature," I'd frame it as "We're trying to solve this logging challenge, and we're not sure if approach A or B would work better with the authentication architecture." This engaged his problem-solving instincts.

There were still moments of friction, but I made a point of addressing issues privately and directly. When he made a dismissive comment in a meeting, I followed up one-on-one afterward: "When you responded that way, it shut down the discussion. I know you have concerns about the approach, but I'd appreciate if we could explore those constructively."

Over time, our working relationship improved dramatically. He was still direct and occasionally abrasive, but he became a valuable collaborator rather than a bottleneck. The team benefited from his expertise, and he seemed more satisfied being brought into discussions earlier.

The experience taught me that sometimes what looks like a difficult personality is actually someone whose strengths and preferences aren't being recognized. Taking the time to understand their perspective and adjust your approach accordingly can transform a challenging relationship into a productive one.

### Question 19: How do you balance collaboration with the need to make timely decisions?

This was a constant tension during the MISE compliance project! We had a hard deadline to identify and flag non-compliant apps, but we also had multiple stakeholders with valuable input to consider. Finding that balance between inclusive collaboration and decision velocity was challenging.

What I developed was a framework I call "collaborative efficiency." At the beginning of the project, I worked with the key stakeholders to define different types of decisions and how we'd handle each type:

For "Type 1" decisions—major architectural choices or ones with significant user impact—we agreed to have collaborative sessions with all stakeholders. But I'd set clear timeboxes and decision deadlines upfront. We might say, "We'll discuss this for two weeks, then make a call by February 15th."

For "Type 2" decisions—important but more contained choices—we'd identify a smaller group of 2-3 key people who would consult with their respective teams but have authority to decide. This prevented decision bottlenecks while still ensuring relevant perspectives were considered.

For "Type 3" decisions—day-to-day implementation details—we empowered individual teams to make calls within the guardrails we'd established together.

What made this work was being extremely transparent about which type of decision we were making and why. Before meetings, I'd clarify: "This is a Type 1 decision about how we'll define compliance, so we need all voices in the room" or "This is a Type 2 decision about the dashboard interface, so we're looking for input but the UX team will make the final call."

I also implemented a concept of "reversible vs. irreversible decisions." For easily reversible choices, we'd lean toward faster decision-making with the understanding that we could adjust course later if needed. For harder-to-reverse decisions, we'd invest more in upfront collaboration.

When we did have extended discussions, I made sure they remained productive by capturing open questions and action items in a shared document. This prevented us from rehashing the same points in meeting after meeting.

The approach wasn't perfect—there were still times when people felt we moved too quickly or too slowly—but it gave us a shared language for balancing collaboration with progress. And critically, we met our deadline while still ensuring the solution incorporated diverse perspectives.

### Question 20: Tell me about a time when you needed to build coalition support for a project or initiative.

The passwordless sign-in security enhancement was actually a perfect example of this. When we discovered the security monitoring gap, I initially thought it would be a straightforward fix—just correct the data format and move on. But I quickly realized that to implement this properly, we needed buy-in and support from multiple teams, none of which had this work on their roadmaps.

My approach to building this coalition started with one-on-one conversations rather than large meetings. I met separately with the leaders from the API team, security team, and UX team to understand their current priorities and constraints. This helped me identify potential resistance points early and shape my pitch accordingly.

Next, I focused on connecting the work to each team's existing goals rather than positioning it as a new initiative. For the security team, I framed it as enhancing our threat detection capabilities (which was already a priority for them). For the UX team, I connected it to their goal of improving transparency for users. And for the API team, I showed how this work aligned with their reliability objectives.

I also gathered compelling data to create urgency. I worked with our analytics team to quantify how many denied authentication attempts were currently invisible to users. Then I created a simple visualization showing the security blind spot this created. This was much more powerful than just explaining the issue conceptually.

Another key step was finding the right executive sponsor. I identified a security director who was passionate about user protection and walked them through the issue. Having their visible support made a huge difference in getting teams to prioritize the work.

For the actual collaboration, I made participation as low-friction as possible. Instead of asking teams to attend new standing meetings, I offered to join their existing team meetings for the relevant discussions. I also created very clear, minimal asks for each team so they understood exactly what commitment they were making.

Throughout the process, I made sure to give public recognition to contributing teams, especially in updates to leadership. This reinforced the collaborative nature of the work and ensured teams got credit for their support.

The coalition-building paid off—we got all the necessary teams engaged and aligned on a shared timeline, even though none of them had planned for this work initially. And the result was a much more comprehensive security solution than we could have built working in isolation.


### Question 21: How do you approach technical problem-solving when you encounter a complex issue?

During the MISE dSTS project, we hit this really tricky technical challenge with data processing. The compliance data was stored in these enormous Parquet files in Azure Data Lake, and we needed to process and combine it with our application metadata in near real-time.

My approach to tackling this started with breaking down the problem. Instead of seeing it as one massive challenge, I mapped out the data flow on a whiteboard - where it started, what transformations it needed, and where it needed to end up. This visual representation helped me identify distinct components we could tackle separately.

Then I formed what I'd call a "technical investigation squad" - a small group with different expertise. I pulled in someone from the data engineering team who knew Azure Synapse Analytics, someone from our app platform who understood our metadata structure, and a performance engineer who could help with optimizing the solution.

Rather than jumping straight to a full implementation, we built a proof-of-concept that processed a small subset of the data. This let us validate our approach without committing too many resources. We discovered some interesting challenges - like the fact that the data schema occasionally changed without notice, which would break our processing pipeline.

What worked really well was setting up regular debugging sessions where we'd walk through the data flow together, looking at input and output at each stage. Sometimes just explaining the problem to others would spark solutions.

When we hit roadblocks, I'd encourage the team to step back and ask, "What assumptions are we making that might be wrong?" This led to some breakthrough moments - like when we realized we didn't need to process the entire dataset each time, but could use delta processing for efficiency.

The final solution was actually quite elegant - a multi-stage pipeline that could handle schema variations and process only changed data. But what I took away from this experience was that solving complex technical problems is rarely about having a flash of brilliance. It's about methodical decomposition, challenging assumptions, and bringing together the right mix of expertise.

### Question 22: Tell me about a time when you had to make a difficult trade-off between competing priorities.

This came up in a big way during the passwordless sign-in project. We were implementing enhanced security monitoring for denied authentication attempts, and we faced a critical trade-off between comprehensive data collection and user privacy.

From a pure security standpoint, we wanted to capture as much context as possible about each denied attempt - the device details, precise location, application information, and authentication patterns. This would give users the best chance of identifying potentially malicious attempts.

But our privacy team raised valid concerns that this level of data collection could be seen as intrusive, especially for legitimate denials (like when a user tries to sign in from a new device and intentionally denies the request while they verify it's actually them).

I was caught between the security team pushing for maximum data collection and the privacy team advocating for minimal collection. Both had valid perspectives based on their areas of focus.

To navigate this, I first made sure I truly understood both sides' concerns. I had detailed conversations with the security architects about exactly what data points were most valuable for threat detection, rather than just collecting everything possible. Similarly, I worked with the privacy team to understand their specific concerns rather than just a general push for less data.

Then I facilitated a workshop where both teams could directly discuss the trade-offs. Instead of positioning it as security versus privacy, I framed it as "How do we maximize user protection while respecting privacy boundaries?" This subtle shift in framing helped create more collaborative problem-solving.

The compromise we reached was quite nuanced. We decided to implement tiered data collection - basic information for all denied attempts, with additional context collected only when certain risk signals were present. We also added clearer user consent messaging and controls, allowing users to opt into more comprehensive monitoring if they were concerned about unauthorized access.

What made this work was being transparent about the trade-offs rather than pretending we could have everything. By acknowledging that both security and privacy were legitimate priorities, we were able to design a solution that balanced them thoughtfully rather than just picking a winner.

The experience taught me that difficult trade-offs aren't just about deciding what's most important - they're about finding creative ways to honor multiple priorities when they seem to be in conflict.

### Question 23: How do you approach gathering and prioritizing requirements for a new project?

When I first took on the MISE compliance project, the initial requirements were honestly pretty vague - basically just "We need to flag non-compliant dSTS apps on our dashboard." I knew we needed a much clearer picture before we could build anything useful.

My approach started with identifying the key stakeholders and their different perspectives. There was the MISE team who owned the compliance rules, application owners who would need to take action based on our flagging, our engineering team who'd build the solution, and the dashboard team who'd need to integrate it.

For initial requirements gathering, I used a combination of methods. I had one-on-one discussions with the technical leads to understand the data structures and technical constraints. For the business requirements, I organized a workshop with the MISE team where we walked through specific examples of non-compliant apps and what exactly made them non-compliant.

What was really helpful was creating user journeys. I mapped out specifically how an application owner would discover their app was non-compliant, understand why, and take action to fix it. This exercise uncovered requirements that hadn't been mentioned explicitly - like the need for documentation links specific to each type of compliance issue.

For prioritization, I used a simple but effective framework. We categorized requirements into:
Must-have: Requirements without which the solution would fail its basic purpose
Should-have: Important features that could potentially be delivered in a later phase
Nice-to-have: Features that would enhance the solution but weren't critical

I also added a "feasibility" dimension, working with the engineering team to rate how technically challenging each requirement would be to implement.

What made this prioritization especially effective was involving stakeholders in the process rather than just presenting them with my conclusions. We had a prioritization session where each stakeholder could advocate for requirements they felt were most important, but within a framework that forced tough choices.

The final requirement set was much more detailed than the initial request, with clear acceptance criteria for each item. And because stakeholders had been involved in the prioritization, there was already buy-in for the scope decisions we'd made together.

This approach saved us from the classic problem of scope creep and ensured we were building something that truly met the business need rather than just following vague initial directions.

### Question 24: Describe how you've handled a situation where a project wasn't meeting its goals.

About midway through the passwordless sign-in project, we hit a serious roadblock. We'd built the enhanced security logging for denied authentication attempts, but our testing revealed that under certain conditions, the data wasn't showing up correctly in the user activity feed. The deadline was approaching, and it was clear we weren't going to meet our goals with the current approach.

My first step was to be transparent about the situation. I didn't want to hide the issues or give false reassurance. I scheduled a meeting with the key stakeholders and laid out exactly where we were, what was working, and what wasn't. This wasn't a fun conversation, but establishing that shared reality was crucial.

Next, I organized what I call a "solution sprint" - a concentrated two-day effort with our core engineering team to diagnose the root cause and identify possible paths forward. We discovered that the activity feed had some undocumented constraints on how it processed certain types of events, which was causing our data to be displayed inconsistently.

With this understanding, we developed three possible options:
Modify our approach to work within the activity feed constraints (fastest but would limit some functionality)
Work with the activity feed team to update their processing logic (most complete but would take longest)
Create a separate view for denied authentications (middle ground for time but created a fragmented user experience)

Rather than just picking one, I prepared a decision document outlining the pros, cons, and timelines for each option. I met with the product and engineering leadership to review these options and get their input on the trade-offs.

We ultimately decided on a hybrid approach - we'd implement option 1 to meet the immediate deadline, while simultaneously starting work on option 2 for a more complete solution in the next release cycle.

To ensure we stayed on track with the revised plan, I increased our monitoring - daily status checks instead of weekly, and more frequent testing cycles. I also proactively identified areas where we might need additional support and lined up resources from other teams who could help if needed.

The project did ship on time with the core functionality, though with some limitations that we were transparent about. And because we'd already started work on the more complete solution, we were able to deliver the full functionality just three weeks later.

What I learned from this experience is that when a project is at risk, the worst thing you can do is hope things will magically improve. Being direct about the challenges, involving the right people in finding alternatives, and then executing decisively on a revised plan is much more effective than trying to force the original plan to work when it clearly won't.

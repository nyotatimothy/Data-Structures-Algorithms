# Technical Project Discussion Guide

## Main Question
"Can you tell me about a technical project you've worked on recently? First, I'd like to understand what the point of the project was, and then I'd like to dive into how it worked. If you can pick something that you are proud of and think showcases your technical ability that would be great."

### Key Elements of the Question:
- **Recent**: Should showcase current skillset
- **Context First**: High-level overview before technical details
- **Showcase Ability**: Should demonstrate high-end capabilities

### Initial Evaluation
- Focus on understanding the project context for follow-ups
- Assess communication skills:
  - Can they explain the project concisely?
  - Is the explanation clear?
- Look for potential Customer Focus or Drive For Results indicators

## Follow-up Questions

### 1. System Design
- Ask candidate to whiteboard/draw the system design
- Clarify candidate's role:
  - Which components did they design/code/lead?
  - Which components were owned by others?

#### Evaluation Points
- Technical Excellence assessment
- Design and Implementation skills
- Solution complexity appropriate for level
- Ability to explain and defend design decisions

### 2. Technical Challenges
"What part of the system gave you the most problems? What was the most difficult piece to get right? How did you resolve it?"

#### Evaluation Points
For technical problems:
- Deep dive into problem and solution
- Assess Technical Excellence
- Evaluate Design and Implementation skills

For non-technical problems, evaluate Drive for Results:

##### Positive Indicators
- Shows ownership
- Demonstrates concrete learning
- Appropriate escalation

##### Negative Indicators
- Blame shifting
- Premature escalation
- Lack of learning/implementation

### 2b. Technical Deep Dive
If #2 yields non-technical answers, request detailed explanation of a specific system component

### 3. Design Disagreements
"Did you have any disagreements about the design or implementation? How did you resolve them?"

#### Evaluation Points for Collaboration

##### Positive Indicators
- Clear decision-making process
- Learning implementation
- Appropriate escalation
- Understanding of multiple perspectives

##### Negative Indicators
- Claims of no disagreements (context dependent)
- Quick escalations
- Lack of process
- Negative portrayal of others

## Optional Follow-ups

### Component Knowledge
"Can you explain how [component they don't own] works?"
- Tests Technical Excellence
- Evaluates Collaboration
- Particularly valuable for components outside their ownership

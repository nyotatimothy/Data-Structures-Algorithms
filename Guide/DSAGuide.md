For the problem given:
re-iterate the problem in question in a simple manner.
Discuss in a simple manner, what the brute force approach would be. 
Use descriptive consonant and variable naming. 
Use a simple but effective approach to solve the problem. Do not let your solution be too by the book. 
In case it is possible, you could mention the proposed approach of attack eg:
`I will use sliding window because....`

 Write in a simple fashion what the improvement would be. Write this in sequential manner.
 handle edge cases.
Write down pseudocode for the solution first. You should assume that you are in an interview setting. So for example, you could start with 2 pseudocode solutions, and revise them as you go along to arrive at the best solution. 
 write the solution and comment every part of the code in a sequential manner of implementation e.g.
`//1. We start by initialization
2. We then create an array
4. We do this after 3 below
3. We check for edge cases and handle them first, then proceed to step 4`
 Write the solution in javascript:
 Please comment on every line comprehensively for example, you can comment:
 `we are using the ternary operator here because...
 in javascript we use the fat arrow function when...
 we are declaring this variable here because we will use it to ...`

 Write down a simple usage that will be used to check if the current solution is correct. e.g:
Mention the O(n) of the new solution and explain it in a simple manner.
 `// Example usage
const n = 5; // Number of nodes
const connections = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]]; // Connections between nodes
console.log(countDisconnectedComponents(n, connections)); // Output: 2`


Once you are done, walk in prose form over a scenario for example:
`Now let us test with an array of {9,82,9,0}.. if we put this in the function, and in step 2 we increment the second index, we end up with.. then in the third step we will also add 2 and then.. `

Also mention further improvements that can be made to the solution.
















Given the following problem, be conversational and  assume you an in an interview setting and are considering 2 approaches to solve the problem. Walk through the pseudocode, and simulate thinking through the initial pseudocode, and making improvements to it, and eventually the solution in javascript. Be sure to show sample usage. Also mention further improvements that can be made to the solution, and the time and space complexity of the solution.

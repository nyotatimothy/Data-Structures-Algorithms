# Coding Interview Guide: Design and Implementation Questions

## Overview
When a candidate is asked to "Design and implement a function that does XYZ", the goal is to evaluate their ability to:
1. Develop an algorithm for a concrete problem
2. Translate that algorithm into actual code

Language choice is flexible, but real code (not pseudo-code) is required. Basic error checking is important, though extensive error handling is not necessary.

## Four Key Parts

### 1. Approach Explanation
- Candidate should explain their general approach unprompted
- If prompting is needed, note it as a potential issue with:
  - Communication (if they had an approach but didn't explain)
  - Problem solving (if they didn't develop an approach first)
- Ensure their approach is viable before proceeding
- Candidate should demonstrate basic understanding, even if edge cases aren't fully explored

### 2. Problem Clarification
- Answer questions to clarify the problem when needed
- Guide candidates to make their own design decisions
  - Example Q: "Is O(n) good enough here?"
  - Example A: "What do you think? Could you do better?"

### 3. Code Implementation
- Maintain hands-off approach if initial strategy is sound
- Focus on ability to translate concepts to code
- Syntax precision is not critical
- Library functions are allowed unless they're central to the problem
  - If exact API is unclear, let candidate define the contract

### 4. Code Verification
- Candidate should test code without prompting
- They should explain their testing approach
- Treat this like a code review
- Clear explanation of the solution is essential

## Follow-up Discussion
- Additional scenarios and modifications may be discussed
- Can be either optional or required based on the question
- Often used to relate problem to real-world applications
- Opportunity to discuss how this applies to our work

## Note for Interviewers
When reviewing the coding questions in sub-pages:
- Try implementing solutions before checking the provided answer
- This helps understand the candidate's experience better

# Project Overview

## Main Aim and Impact
The Secure Future Initiative focused on enhancing the MISE portal by identifying and flagging non-compliant dSTS applications. This initiative was crucial for maintaining security standards and ensuring compliance across Microsoft's services. The impact provided the MISE team and partners with improved capabilities to address compliance issues, ultimately strengthening data integrity and trust in Microsoft's ecosystem.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Data Complexity
We faced significant challenges working with complex data stored in parquet files. I led the development of a comprehensive data model, collaborating closely with our data scientists to ensure we captured all necessary details and could effectively process the data.

### IDX Deployment Cadence 
The standard two-week deployment cycle with IDX presented a significant bottleneck. I identified this as an opportunity for improvement and proposed a flexible deployment strategy to my manager. After receiving approval, I successfully onboarded our artifacts into IDX's flexible system, reducing deployment time from weeks to hours and improving our responsiveness to MISE team requirements.

### Data Processing and Rule Application
Implementing compliance rules presented complex challenges. I took ownership of developing processing flows that strictly adhered to our data model's rules. This involved multiple iterations of testing and validation to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## Ownership and Leadership

### Project Breakdown and Management
I took initiative by breaking down the project into manageable components. This approach enabled parallel work streams and ensured we met our deadlines. I coordinated team efforts by leveraging individual strengths and maintaining project momentum.

### Escalation and Resolution
When deployment challenges arose, I proactively escalated the issue and presented a well-researched alternative solution to my manager, demonstrating commitment to project success and timeline adherence.

## Learning and Future Preparedness

### Learning from IDX Integration
The experience with IDX's flexible deployment system provided valuable insights. I documented all processes and shared learnings with the team, creating a knowledge base for future projects facing similar challenges.

### Continuous Improvement
I established a feedback mechanism with the MISE team for ongoing process refinement. This approach ensured we not only met current requirements but also prepared for future needs.

## Technical Implementation

### Data Ingestion and Processing
1. **Data Extraction**
   - Implemented data pulls from MISE portal using parquet files
   - Utilized Apache Spark on IDX for efficient data processing

3. **Flow Monitoring**
   - Though not initially required, I proactively implemented comprehensive flow monitoring
   - Set up alerts and dashboards to track processing status and performance
   - Enabled early detection of potential issues before they impacted production

### Data Storage and Visualization
1. **Results Storage**
   - Implemented Azure SQL Database for processed data storage
   - Designed schema for flagged applications and compliance metrics
   - Maintained historical data for trend analysis

2. **PowerBI Integration**
   - Developed interactive dashboards for stakeholder insights
   - Connected real-time data updates from Azure SQL
   - Created detailed reports for flagged applications

## Team Collaboration
Throughout the project, I maintained strong communication channels with all stakeholders. Regular check-ins and open dialogue ensured alignment and swift issue resolution. I fostered a collaborative environment where team members felt comfortable sharing challenges and solutions.

## Impact and Results
The Secure Future Initiative successfully enhanced MISE portal security through automated compliance monitoring. The implementation of flexible deployment and robust data processing significantly improved operational efficiency. The project established a foundation for continuous improvement in compliance monitoring and security maintenance across Microsoft's services.

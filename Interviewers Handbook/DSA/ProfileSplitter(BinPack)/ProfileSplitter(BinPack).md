# BinPack Algorithm: Real-world Example from Exchange Test Automation Lab (2005)

## Context

The Exchange team had hundreds of thousands of automated test cases. Each evening, the official build would compile all product code and create a release drop. An automated test lab would build isolated cloned environments - real VMs/PCs with Windows installed that would:
- Install Exchange
- Set up the environment 
- Run a pre-determined set of tests

### Challenges

1. Test case tracking system and profiles were organized by business/organizational structure rather than for efficient parallelism
2. The automation lab had multiple competing resource demands
3. System limitations required static analysis and sending complete "profiles" (test case sets) upfront rather than dynamic allocation
4. Time pressure from engineers waiting on results
5. Without optimization, test runs would take multiple days - causing lost dev hours

## Technical Requirements

Create an algorithm that takes:
1. Number of profiles (buckets) to optimize for - representing available test environments
2. List of test cases - each containing:
   - ID
   - Runtime (assumed accurate)

The algorithm should return a list of profiles, with each profile containing a list of test cases.

Focus should be on static analysis/allocation/runtime optimization rather than:
- Serialization
- Deserialization
- Machine communication

**Primary Goal**: Minimize total completion time across all profiles

## Evaluation Criteria

Key elements for successful optimization:

1. Sort input by longest test case first
   - Without sorting, algorithms become easily exploitable
2. Track current summed runtime for each profile/bucket
3. Sort buckets by shortest current runtime

## Common Pitfalls

### Averages-based Approaches
- Natural initial approach
- Leads to either:
  - Poor performance in most cases
  - Overly complex code with many edge cases

## Solution Approaches

### 1. BinPack via Double Sort (Elegant Solution)
**Pros:**
- Simple double-sort implementation
- Minimal failure points
- Highly maintainable

**Cons:**
- Not 100% optimal performance
- Some data sets may show minor suboptimal results
- Benefits of simplicity/stability generally outweigh slight performance tradeoffs

### 2. Innovative Sorted Percentiles
- Breaks problem into percentile-based segments
- Results approach BinPack performance
- Still generally underperforms compared to BinPack

### 3. Iterative Average
- Calculate initial average
- Identify significant outliers
- Handle outliers separately
- Recalculate average
- Interesting concept but complex implementation
- No known working implementations observed
